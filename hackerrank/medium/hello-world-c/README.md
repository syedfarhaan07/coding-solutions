# "Hello World!" in C

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

**Objective**

In this challenge, we will learn some basic concepts of C that will get you started with the language. You will need to use the same syntax to read input and write output in many C challenges.  As you work through these problems, review the code stubs to learn about reading from stdin and writing to stdout.  

**Task**

This challenge requires you to print $Hello, World!$ on a single line, and then print the already provided input string to [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29).  If you are not familiar with C, you may want to read about the printf() command.  

**Example**  
$s = \text{"Life is beautiful"}$   

The required output is:
    
    Hello, World!  
    Life is beautiful  
    
**Function Descriptio**  

Complete the main() function below.

The main() function has the following input:  

- *string s:* a string  

**Prints**  

- *two strings: * "Hello, World!" on one line and the input string on the next line.  


**Input Format**

There is one line of text, $s$.

**Constraints**

   

**Output Format**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char s[100];

    fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin);

    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    printf("%s", s);

    return 0;
}

```
